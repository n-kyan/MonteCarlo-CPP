    - Proper seeding

- **Box-Muller Transform**
    - Gaussian random numbers

- **Template-Based Design**
    - 

- Performance Benchmarking
    - >10M random num/sec
    - std lib not optomized for Monte Carlo sims
    - 40% performance boost

### Market Parameters & Greek Infrastructure

    - 

- **Interest rate curve handling**
    - 

- **Dividend yield modeling**
    - 

- **Greek calculation framework** (delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho)
    - 


## Phase 2: Monte Carlo Engine

### Path Generation Engine
Target: >500k paths/second for vanilla options

- **Geometric Brownian Motion**
    - With drift and volatility

- **Antithetic variates**
    - variance reduction

- **Control variates** (analytical approximations)

- **Multi-threading**
    - Thread-local random number generators

- **SIMD optimization**
    - 

Statistical Validation System

Convergence analysis with confidence intervals
Bias testing against Black-Scholes analytical solutions
Standard error calculations and reporting
Automated benchmarking against known results

Phase 3: Options Pricing Models (3-4 hours)
Career Impact: Demonstrates quantitative finance knowledge and model implementation skills
Vanilla Options

European Call/Put with Greeks
American options using Longstaff-Schwartz method
Barrier options (knock-in/knock-out)
Asian options (arithmetic and geometric averages)

Advanced Features

Path-dependent payoffs
Multi-asset correlations (basic basket options)
Early exercise optimization

Interview Talking Point: "I didn't just implement Black-Scholes. I built American option pricing with optimal exercise boundaries and exotic options with path-dependent payoffs. This shows I can handle the complexity of real trading books."
Phase 4: Production Features (2-3 hours)
Career Impact: Shows understanding of production system requirements
