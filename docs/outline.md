Monte Carlo Options Pricing Engine: Strategic Project Blueprint
Phase-by-Phase Breakdown (3 Days, Maximum Career Impact)
Phase 1: High-Performance Infrastructure (Day 1, 4-5 hours)
Career Value: Demonstrates systems programming skills that 90% of finance majors lack
Core Components:

Thread-Safe Random Number Generator

Custom Mersenne Twister implementation with SIMD optimization
Multiple streams for parallel Monte Carlo paths
Interview Talking Point: "I implemented a custom RNG with 4x performance improvement over std::random"


Market Parameters & Volatility Models

Black-Scholes parameters with real market data validation
Heston stochastic volatility (stretch goal)
Interview Talking Point: "I chose Heston over simpler models because it captures volatility smile effects"


Memory Management Architecture

Custom allocators for path generation
RAII-compliant resource management
Interview Talking Point: "I reduced memory allocations by 80% using custom pool allocators"



Phase 2: Core Pricing Engine (Day 2, 4-5 hours)
Career Value: Proves you understand both mathematical finance and high-performance computing
Implementation:

Vectorized Path Generation

SIMD-optimized geometric Brownian motion
Parallel path execution using std::execution policies
Benchmark Target: >500k paths/second on M1 MacBook


Multi-Asset Support

European calls/puts, American options, exotic payoffs
Barrier options (knock-in/knock-out)
Interview Talking Point: "I implemented both European and American options to show I understand early exercise premiums"


Antithetic Variates & Control Variates

Variance reduction techniques
Convergence acceleration
Interview Talking Point: "I achieved 50% variance reduction using control variates, demonstrating statistical sophistication"



Phase 3: Production Features (Day 3, 4-5 hours)
Career Value: Shows you think like a professional developer, not a student
Professional Polish:

Statistical Validation Framework

Convergence analysis with confidence intervals
Greeks calculation (delta, gamma, theta, vega)
Comparison against Black-Scholes analytical solutions


Performance Profiling & Benchmarking

Latency measurements with std::chrono
Memory usage tracking
Scalability analysis across thread counts


Professional Documentation

Technical design document
Performance benchmarks
Code comments explaining financial concepts



Strategic Technical Decisions (Interview Gold)
Why This Architecture Beats Student Projects:

Custom RNG vs std::random_device

"I implemented thread-local Mersenne Twister streams because std::random_device has serialization bottlenecks in Monte Carlo simulations"


SIMD Optimization

"I used ARM NEON intrinsics to vectorize the path generation, achieving 4x speedup over scalar code"


Memory Pool Allocation

"I pre-allocated path storage to eliminate dynamic allocation overhead during pricing"


Statistical Rigor

"I implemented proper convergence testing because production systems need confidence bounds, not just point estimates"

Key Interview Talking Points We're Building:

Technical Depth: "I chose Monte Carlo over binomial trees because it scales better to multi-asset derivatives"
Performance Engineering: "I achieved >500k simulation paths per second using SIMD vectorization and custom memory management"
Statistical Sophistication: "I implemented variance reduction techniques that cut simulation error by 50%"
Production Mindset: "I built comprehensive convergence analysis because production trading systems need confidence bounds"
Optimization Skills: "I profiled every bottleneck and achieved 10x performance improvement over naive implementation"

Success Metrics for Each Phase:

Phase 1: RNG generating >10M samples/second, clean architecture
Phase 2: >500k Monte Carlo paths/second, <1% pricing error vs analytical
Phase 3: Complete documentation, professional benchmarks, Greeks calculation
